This is a bit of a todo as I get used to how a markdown blog is supposed to work.

- I would like to add a short blog format for tips and quick TILs. I think this should probably be built into a tagging system of some kind so that I can access them by subject. [Link](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-tags-and-categories-to-blog-posts/)
- Need to add code snippets? highlighting? I haven't looked into this at all yet.

# code block

```
alert('does this work?');
```
